# Contest Problem Project

Your task is to create a programming contest problem, similar to the labs that you've done in class where data is read from a file and output is compared to the expected output.

## Instructions

Create a file in this folder named `instructions.md` that contains the instructions for your problem. It must be written in markdown and explain the task to perform.

Make sure that the instructions include a sample input and output section so that whoever gets your problem knows what the data looks like. It should not be the complete test data set though.

Take a look at the review labs we've done if you need any ideas.

## Data Files

You'll also need to create two data files for your problem named `something.dat` and `something.out` (replace `something` with the name of your problem).

`something.dat` contains the input that the program should read. Typically this will be a single integer on the first line with the count of number of tests to follow. Each subsequent line is part of a test. The example input in the instructions is usually a subset of the data contained in `something.dat`.

`something.out` is the expected output from running the program. A subset of this file is also usually used in the instructions as an example. 

## Solution

And, you'll need to provide a working solution to prove that it can be solved. This should be done in a single Java file added to your repository. 

## Notes

Another member of the class will be given your problem to solve. You do not want it to be so easy that there's no challenge, but you also don't want to kick them in the shins with something so difficult that they can't solve it. Create a problem that would push you a bit, but that you could ultimately solve.
