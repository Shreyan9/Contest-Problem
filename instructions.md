# Contest Problem Project

The Pre Cal class has run out of calculators for their trignometry unit and they need an alternative. Write some code to help them out!

## Problem

Write a program that will print the 6 trigonometric values in fraction form from two side values of a triangle. Create a class and any needed methods to solve for these values.

## Input

There will be a integer at the start indicating the amount of problems in the data set. The next two integers will represent the horizontal side of the triangle(x) and the vertical side of the triangle(y). The next sequences of two numbers will follow the same format with the first value being horizontal and second value being vertical.

## Data  Files

`Trigonometry.dat`

`Trigonometry.out`

## Output

Output the Side values as well as the Hypotenuse, followed by a sequence of the Trigonometric values in fractice form. Make sure to enter a space after each sequence.

## Sample Input

`1 //number of sequences`

`5 //horizontal side`

`12 // vertical side`

## Sample Output

Horizontal side length = 5

Vertical side length = 12

Hypotenuse length = 13

Sin x = 12/13

Cos x = 5/13

Tan x = 12/5

Csc x = 13/12

Sec x = 13/5

Cot x = 5/12
